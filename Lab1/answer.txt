Question 1
	What will be print out of the program? Why it has such output?
Answer: 
	On my Macbook Pro, the output is:
		0x7fff530e9a5c
		0x7fff530e9a50
		0x7fff530e9a5c
	The output may change for every execution of the program, but the first line and the third line are always the same, and they are different from the second line.
	"&a" is the address of the integer "a".
	"&ap" is the address of the integer pointer "ap", which stores the address of the integer "a".
	"&ar" is the address of "a" since "ar" is a reference of "a".

Question 2
	Reference and pointer have the same performance in most condition, but they are different actually. Please list the differences.
Answer:
	1. A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference can not be re-seated after binding.
	2. Pointers can point nowhere (NULL), whereas reference always refer to an object. ## So a reference must be initialized when it is created, while a pointer need not be. ##
	3. You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.
	4. There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in &obj + 5).
